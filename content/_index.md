Hey there! I'm a software developer based in [Chisinau, Moldova](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chisinau). I write code, read books, listen to music, and occasionally run or cycle until my legs remind me they exist.

I've been building things professionally since 2017, mostly with **Python** and **PHP**, but I never shy away from whatever tool gets the job done. My curiosity often leads me down rabbit holes involving performance optimizations, image/video processing, and the occasional IoT project.

When I'm not debugging someone else's code (or my own from last week), you'll find me exploring new technologies or helping others get started in their dev journey.

## About Me

I started tinkering with tech at 16 and never looked back. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with passionate professionals who've helped shape how I think about software. These days, I enjoy paying that forward.

Fun fact: I'm convinced my [23:27 5K](https://www.strava.com/activities/2858417572/overview) is unbeatable. Prove me wrong.
