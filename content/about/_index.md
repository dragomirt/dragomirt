Hi there! As you might have noticed on the homepage, I do enjoy playing with various types and flavors of software, for fun and for a living. I have a keen interest in performance optimizations and intense computation ( image, video, and 3d manipulation ). Although throughout my career my main area of concern were web technologies, I'm enthusiastic about native platforms, hardware, and IoT.


From the age of 16 when I began working in tech, I have had the chance to meet a lot of deeply passionate and skillful professionals that have helped me enrich and expand my knowledge regarding the aforementioned topics. Today, I enjoy exploring new things about my craft and helping others in their beginnings.

Currently, enrolled in the "Informational Management" degree at the Computer Science department of the Technical University of Moldova.


My hobbies are running and cooking. I'm deeply convinced that my [23:27 5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/2858417572/overview) is unbeatable. Prove me wrong :P
